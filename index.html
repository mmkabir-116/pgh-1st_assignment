            someting and it works just the you want, that is a very precious
            felling and it gives me kick/thril.

          <p class="s2-ptext">
            I have been studying Computer Science for two years but I have not
            done anything worthwhile. I came to realize that with the current
            skillset, I won't get a job. Thats why I want to improve my skills
            before this year passes like the previous years.

          <h1>Vision</h1>
          <p class="s2-ptext">
            I am a visionary man. I want to change the word for the better.
            Recently, there have been many road accidents. I want an accident
            free road. For that, we must have control over the drivers and the
            vehicles. So, I want to build a system that can monitor every move
            the driver makes and every turn the vehicles take. Thus provide the
            driver with live traffic feed and instructions.

          <h1>Goal</h1>
          <p class="s2-ptext">
            As I have mentioned erlier, with the current skillset I cant land a
            job. So, I want to aquire the necessary knowledge and skills to land
            a part time job or an intership by next year. I want to make money
            and support my parents.

            I know that if I try to achive something with my heart and soul, I
            can do it. I don't have much prior knowledge. But This is a fresh
            start. I want to give it my all. I have reaserched a little and
            found out that React and NodeJs are very demanding at the moment. So
            I pulled some React tutorials and I loved them. But the thing is,
            they don't go in depth and fill the lackings. So I have decided to
            read a book.
